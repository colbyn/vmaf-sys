# Notes
Since the latest (Netflix/vmaf)[https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf] version tags are too old for this library (doesn’t include required updates). This library now builds from a fork at [/colbyn/vmaf/tree/vmaf-sys--0.0.10](https://github.com/colbyn/vmaf/tree/vmaf-sys--0.0.10).

This is what I should have done originally. Now all old versions on crates.io won’t build, since originally this library built directly from the master branch.
